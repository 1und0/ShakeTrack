Dataset: Acceleration data of 90 handshakes, recorded with motion sensors at the wrist and at the finger. During the acquisition process, 60 people participated in pairs of two. Consequently, the dataset consists of 30 unique pairings. To reduce the impact of outliers each pairing contributed three handshakes.
